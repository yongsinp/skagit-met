# skagit-met

Exploring meteorology data for use in hydrologic modeling of the Skagit River basin

This repository hosts code to construct analysis ready data cubes for the Skagit River basin from a variety of model and observational datasets. There are also Jupyter Notebooks with detailed analysis and figures.

## Environment Setup
We recommend using [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/), an alternate to conda environments that uses a "per-project" rather than "global" environment paradigm. Pixi helps isolate software environments specific to a repository through the use of configuration and lock files to manage dependencies all in one, but backed by the conda-forge repos and pypi.

To use pixi, install it on your machine, clone this repo, then run `pixi install` in the root of the repo.
You may get an error big and long that mentions 'clang' or something like that. If that's the case run `export CFLAGS="-Wno-incompatible-function-pointer-types -Wno-implicit-function-declaration"` and try again. This is pre-run as a part of the setup script for the conda environment.

To play around with the jupyter notebooks, just run `pixi run nb`, and a local instance of jupyter will be launched for you with all the necessary packages and dependencies. It's quite magic.

### DSHydro JupyterHub

[The DSHydro JupyterHub](https://dshydro.ce.washington.edu/jupyter/hub) is a limited-access JupyterHub running on servers at the University of Washington.

1. Run `curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash` to install pixi for your user
2. Install the data-download environment or analysis environment using `pixi install -e data-download` and `pixi install -e analysis`
3. To look at the analysis notebook, install the analysis kernel with the following command: `./skagit-met/.pixi/envs/analysis/bin/python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=skagit_analysis`
4. Once installed, open the .ipynb file you wish to look at, and select the skagit_analyis kernel.

### Cloud-hosted JupyterHub:

[Cryocloud](https://book.cryointhecloud.com/content/Getting_Started.html) is a NASA-supported JupyterHub running in AWS us-west-2. The environment setup is the same as above!

### Conda environment:
If you prefer to use conda, there is also a script to install necessary packages in a global conda environment
1. Clone this repo
2. In the root of the repo, run `./setup.sh` - this creates the conda environment, installs whats needed, etc.
3. Enter the environment using `conda activate skagit-met`
4. If you're done, don't forget to `conda deactivate`.
